# Why?
To make building projects with Coding LLMs absolute EHZT experience (Empty Head Zero Thoughts).
# How?
By shamelessly feeding it the entire codebase.
# What?
A script that just takes project folderpath, and spits everything combined into a single file, which is much easier for LLMs to handle, and saves us some tedious clicking.
# But that's @workspace in Copilot?
No it's worse (or better, depends on your project), but I didn't like copilot and prefer normal consumer grade Claude.
